You are now entering VulneLora Interactive mode...

In this mode, you can run several attacks, targeting multiple parts of a traditional LoRa@FIIT infrastructure.
Attacks are configured by interacting with the VulneLora program and setting the attack parameters.

It is recommended to read the help page of the chosen attack in order to know which arguments are supported - type "help" after choosing the attack for more information.
